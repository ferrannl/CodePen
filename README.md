# Realtime Scratching DJ Turntable (CodePen Export)

This repository contains an exported **CodePen project**: a small web experiment that simulates a DJ turntable with realtime “scratching” effects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It’s meant as a fun, self-contained demo you can open directly in the browser, or use as a starting point for more advanced audio/turntable experiments.

## Live Demo

The original pen is available on CodePen:

> **CodePen URL:**  
> https://codepen.io/ferrannl/full/OPMPjmx

Open that link for the original environment, or use `index.html` in this repo to run it locally.

## Features

- 🎚️ **Interactive audio scratch effect** – simulate vinyl scratching by interacting with the UI.
- 🎧 **Custom audio tracks** – the repository ships with local MP3 files used in the demo.
- 🖼 **Cover art** – simple cover art assets to make the turntable/player feel more like a “real” track.
- 🌐 **Pure front-end** – plain HTML/CSS/JS, no backend or build step required.
